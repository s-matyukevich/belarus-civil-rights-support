# The platform that supports civil rights initiatives in Belarus

This is an attempt to build a crowdfunding platform that allows gathering funds for people who lose their jobs because of their civil position, which isn't aligned with the official position of the Belorussian government. 

This is going to work like this:

1. My boss asks me to do election falsification or attack peaceful demonstrators or do anything else that is unlawful and threatens that if I don't do this, I am going to lose my job.  Or I participate in a peaceful protest, I got caught by the police, and after that, my boss refuses to renew my job contract. Or ...
1. I publish my story on the website. The website connects me with the people who want to help and makes it easy for them to donate money to me. 

The project is in the early stage of development and needed contributors. Please, see [Issues](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/belarus-civil-rights-support/issues) for more details.
